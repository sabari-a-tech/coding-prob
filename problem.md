# Problem: Find the Maximum Number in a List

Create a function that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum number in the list. You can assume that the list contains at least one number.

## Example 1:
- Input: nums = [3, 1, 5, 6, 2]
- Output: 6

## Example 2:
- Input: nums = [10, 20, 5, 7]
- Output: 20

## Constraints:
- The list will have at least one integer.
- You are not allowed to use the built-in `max()` function.
